## MimeSniffer v2
This PHP class sniffs the MIME type of many common types of files.

## What's new?
Version 2 re-implements the API such that it more closely follows PSR-2.
We have also purged those ugly tests and have started using PHPUnit and Composer.

## How can I use it?
This software is put in the public domain. Why? Because I can't be bothered chasing it everywhere. Call me lazy, eh.  
So, I guess what my point is, is that you may use it however you like. Feel free to clone, modify, poke it, play around. Sell it. I don't mind.

For your convenience, it is available on packagist for use with composer. Just tell your code monkey to run the following:

```
composer require shanept/mime-sniffer
```

You may, of course, download the file and include it in your projects. But that'd be too easy! ;)
